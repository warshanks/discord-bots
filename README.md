## Overview
#### This repository hosts the source code for my Discord bots, including KC, the Lilith variant, and a Ferrari-themed F1 data bot. The bots are developed using Python 3.11 and integrate several libraries and APIs to provide a feature-rich experience.

## Features

- ### Engages in text-to-text conversations using OpenAI's GPT-4, retaining the last 15 messages in the channel
