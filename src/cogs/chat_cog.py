"""
This module imports the necessary libraries for a Discord bot that interacts
with the OpenAI API to generate responses using the GPT-4 model. The bot can
process messages in specific channels and reply with generated content.

Libraries:
    - re: Used for regular expressions to split text and match patterns.
    - openai: Provides an interface to interact with the OpenAI API.
    - discord: A library for creating Discord bots and interacting with the Discord API.
    - discord.ext.commands: Provides a framework for creating commands for the Discord bot.
    - config: A custom module that contains configuration settings, such as API tokens,
              organization ID, and channel IDs for the Discord bot.
